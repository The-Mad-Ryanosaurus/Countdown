### **Introduction**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook discussing Computational Theory to understand, examine and solve via Brute Force the numbers round of the popular TV show, **Countdown**. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate a deep understanding of computational theory and algorithms in everyday computing.

### **Jupyter Notebook Overview**

- **Project Notebook:** This notebook applies computational theory principles to develop and discuss Python functions that explore the numbers round game of the TV programme Countdown. It demonstrates algorithm design, computational paradigms, reverse polish notation and an analysis of the Countdown problem.

### **Installation Setup Guide**

The following is a step by step guide on how you can clone this repository down on to your own machine and get it running. Please ensure you have the following prerequisites installed before continuing.

### **Prerequisites**

Installation of `git` <br>
Installation of `Visual Studio Code`, with extensions `Jupyter` & `notebook`<br>
Installation of `Python 3` (versions 3+)
or
Installation of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)<br>

### **Step 1: Clone Repository:**

In order to clone the github repository, use the following command:<br>
git clone https://github.com/The-Mad-Ryanosaurus/Countdown.git<br>
This link can be found in the code button at the top of this page under the HTTPS tab.

### **Step 2: Install Project Dependencies:**

In the same terminal window you used to clone the repository, do the following step by step:

1. cd countdown
2. `pip install notebook`
3. `pip install memory_profiler`
4. `pip install TIME-python`
5. `pip install more-itertools`

Remember to restart the Jupyter kernel if you encounter any import errors after installation.

Should the installs fail, run your command prompt as an administrator and try again from [Step 1](#step1). If you do not have administration permissions on your machine, try adding '--user' after each 'pip install'. Ex: pip install --user "_dependency_"

### **Step 3: Open Project in Visual Studio Code:**

Still in the same terminal window do the following commands:<br>
code .<br>
This will open VS code and you can now access and run the Countdown jupyter notebook.
