    "## **Countdown**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Countdown numbers game is a segment of the Countdown TV show where contestants are challenged to reach a target number by mathematically combining six numbers together within 30 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"game-rules\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Game Rules**\n",
    "1. **Number Selection:** The contestants choose from 6 out of 24 shuffled face-down number tiles, arranged like so\n",
    "   - **Small Numbers:**  Two groups of the digits ranging from 1 to 10. (Totalling 20 tiles).\n",
    "   - **Large Numbers:**  The numbers 25, 50, 75, and 100. (Totalling 4 tiles).\n",
    "2. **Target Number:** A random target number is generated at the start of the round, ranging from 101 to 999 (inclusive).\n",
    "3. **Time Limit:** Contestants have 30 seconds to use any combination of the six numbers to reach the target number.\n",
    "4. **Mathematic Operations:** Only the four basic arithmetic operations are allowed: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (×), and Division (÷).\n",
    "   - **Operation Rules:** Each of the six numbers can be used once, and operations can be repeated. Division must result in a whole number, and subtraction must result in a positive number.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### **Computational Problems in Everyday Computing**\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"computational-problems-in-everyday-computing\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyday computational challenges are tasks as simple as deciding the quickest route home based on traffic (GPS systems), to complex decisions like managing financial reports in real-time. These tasks require systematic problem-solving frameworks that computers are particularly good at handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Relevance to Countdown:** \n",
    "**In the Countdown game, players face a computational challenge:** Using a limited set of numbers and operations to reach a target number. This mirrors real-world scenarios where resources are limited and must be optimally utilized to achieve a goal, leveraging algorithms to find the best solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Models of Computation**\n",
    "Models of computation are theoretical abstracts that define the rules and guidelines for how data is manipulated within a computational system. Common models include:\n",
    "1. **Finite Automata:** Used primarily for software and hardware design, particularly in applications requiring pattern recognition such as text editors or network protocols.\n",
    "2. **Turing Machines:** A more comprehensive model that describes a theoretical machine capable of simulating any computer algorithm, foundational for understanding what computers can and cannot do.\n",
    "3. **Application to Countdown:** These models help conceptualize the Countdown game as a series of computational steps—selecting numbers, applying operations, and evaluating results—similar to how a Turing machine processes input based on a set of rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Computational Paradigms**\n",
    "Computational paradigms are approaches or styles of programming that dictate how problems are structured and solved.\n",
    "1. **Procedural Programming:** Focuses on a step-by-step instructional approach, ideal for tasks requiring sequential processing. Useful in Countdown for implementing straightforward algorithms that follow specific operations to reach a target.\n",
    "2. **Functional Programming:** Emphasizes applications of functions without mutating data. In Countdown, this could be used to transform sets of numbers through a series of function applications to achieve the target number, ensuring immutability of data.\n",
    "3. **Object-Oriented Programming:** Based on concepts of \"objects,\" which are data structures encapsulating data fields and methods. For Countdown, this might involve creating an object representing each number with methods to apply arithmetic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Potential Use in Solving Countdown:** \n",
    "Each paradigm offers distinct advantages:\n",
    "1. **Procedural:** Provides clear, manageable steps for reaching the target number.\n",
    "2. **Functional:** Ensures no side effects, which is crucial when multiple operations are involved.\n",

    "## **Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)**\n",
    "Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a notation scheme for writing mathematical expressions in which each operator follows the number(s) it operates on. This format simplifies computation for computers, eliminating the need for parentheses or adhering to specific rules for the order of operations. [*[1.0]*](#ian-mcloughlin)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **RPN Applicable to Countdown**\n",
    "Using RPN in Countdown helps streamline the way calculations are processed. In traditional notation, a mathematical operation would be written like (3 + 5) * 2. However, in **RPN**, this expression is written as 3 5 + 2 *. This straight-line processing aligns well with the step-by-step execution that computational tasks often require.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculation Efficiency** \n",
    "By adopting RPN, we can enhance the efficiency of calculations in the Countdown game. This notation minimizes the need for managing operation order and brackets. It makes RPN particularly useful for programmatically solving problems where operations need to be applied as soon as possible, such as in real-time applications or complex problem-solving applications. This makes RPN a practical tool in contexts that demand quick and reliable computation strategies, like with the Countdown game. [dontforgetthis](#dontforgetthis)\n",

    "The brute force algorithm in this code tries to find the target number by testing all possible combinations of the given numbers with basic arithmetic operations, in line with Countdown rules. Here's a breakdown of how the code works:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step-by-Step Breakdown:** \n",
    "1. **Importing Libraries:** The code starts by importing the **itertools library**, which helps in creating combinations of numbers and operations.\n",
    "2. **Function Definition:**\n",
    "- **Purpose:** The **brute_force** function is designed to find the formula that comes closest to a target number using the numbers provided.\n",
    "- **Parameters:** \n",
    "    - **numbers:** A list of numbers you can use. \n",
    "    - **target:** The number you're trying to reach with these numbers.\n",
    "3. **Generating Combinations:**\n",
    "- The code uses nested loops to try every possible order of the given numbers **(nums)** and every combination of operations **(ops)** between those numbers.\n",
    "- For each combination, it constructs a mathematical expression.\n",
    "4. **Validating Expressions:**\n",
    "- As it builds each expression, the code checks to make sure the operations are valid. For example, it avoids division by zero and ensures division results in whole numbers, as the Countdown rules dictate.\n",
    "- It skips any expressions that result in negative numbers or non-whole numbers also.\n",
    "5. **Evaluating Expressions:**\n",
    "- Each valid expression is evaluated to see how close the result is to the target number.\n",
    "- If the result of an expression is closer to the target than anything found before, the code updates the closest expression and the smallest difference (closest_diff).\n",
    "6. **Returning the Best Result:**\n",
    "- After checking all possible combinations, the function returns the expression that got closest to the target and the difference from the target."

RPN would streamline the evaluation by removing the need for managing operator precedence and parentheses, which aligns with the straightforward calculation approach seen here in the above code.\n",
